## 🎯 Overview

**AI Debate Arena** is a multi-agent system powered by [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) that simulates dynamic debates between intelligent agents:

- 🤖 **ProAgent** defends a claim with conviction and tools  
- 🤖 **ConAgent** refutes it with ruthless logic  
- 🧑‍⚖️ **CriticAgent** evaluates each round, scores both sides, and offers feedback  
- 🔁 Infinite looping rounds until the user ends the debate  
- 📜 On-demand final summary with markdown table and verdict  

Built with **Claude 3.5 Haiku**, **Tavily Search**, **LangChain**, and a clean **Streamlit UI**.

## 🧠 How It Works

The app uses LangGraph to define a graph of state transitions:

- A round begins with **ProAgent** and **ConAgent** running in parallel
- **CriticAgent** then scores both arguments, gives feedback + strategy
- A memory step stores round summaries
- Loop continues until user clicks **End Debate**
- You can trigger a **final markdown summary** at the end
